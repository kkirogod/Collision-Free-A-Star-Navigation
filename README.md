# Collision-free-A--Navigation
Navigation routine in which a differential kinematics robot moves along a scenario ```frame6.bmp``` visiting different configurations. The A* algorithm is used to generate collision-free paths between these configurations and then generate admissible paths using cubic splines that the robot must follow.
